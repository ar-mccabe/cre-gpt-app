# Commercial Real Estate GPT - Issue Tracking

Thank you for trying out 'CRE-GPT', if you've come here, then you've probably had a bug (sorry!). I'm working to improve the experience, so for now, your feedback or bug reports are appreciated.

Don't be intimidated by GitHub, adding a ticket or feedback is easy - click `Issues` above, and then click on the green `Add New Issue` button. You can then give it a title, a short (or long) description and hit submit.
